## Technologies Used
**Frontend:**
    - React
    - JavaScript
    - CSS

**Backend:**
    - Python
    - https://github.com/linem-davton/es-lab-task2.git



## Features
- **Upload JSON File**: Also, one can upload a JSON file to visualize a pre-defined Application model.
- **Add Nodes and Edges**: Users can create a graph of the Application model by adding nodes and edges interactively through the interface.
- **Graph Visualization**: The application provides a clear visualization of the Application model, making it easy to understand task dependencies.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: The application can schedule the graph using five different algorithms, offering flexibility and multiple approaches.
- **Schedule Visualization**: Users can visualize the resulting schedules in a bar graph format, providing a clear overview of the task timeline.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The application works seamlessly across different devices and browsers.



## Usage

### For Users

1. **Accessing the Application**
   - Open the web browser and navigate to the application URL 'https://eslab2.pages.dev/'.

   - **Upload JSON File**: Click on the "Upload JSON" button to upload a pre-defined Application model. The  JSON file should follow the input schema defined at 'https://eslab2docs.pages.dev/README#api-input-schema-for-schedule-jobs'.
   
   - **Load Default Json file**: Clicking on the "Load Default Json" will load a default application model.

   - **Saving and Exporting**: Export the updated JSON file containing the Application and Platform model by clicking the "Download JSON" button. This will download the JSON file to your device, allowing you to save it locally or share it with others as needed.
   Alternatively, "Save Locally" button will save the models locally which can be accessed on later page visits by "Load Last Saved" button.

   
 2. **Creating Application Model**
    - **Add Tasks and Task Dependencies**: Create your own Application model by selecting the "Application model" on the screen. Use the "Add Tasks" button to create tasks individually and tasks dependencies using the "Add dependency" button.

    - **Sliders**: WCET and deadline for a task can be changed by clicking on the task and adjusting the respective sliders.

    - **Delete Mode**: The tasks and Edges can be deleted by first clicking on the "Delete Mode" button then selecting the task or edge you want to delete.

    - **Generate Random Application Model**: Generate a random application model by entering the number of tasks. 

    - **Visualizing the Application Model**:The Application model will be displayed as a directed acyclic graph. Nodes represent tasks, and edges represent dependencies between tasks.


3. **Creating Platform Model**
   
   - **Add Nodes and Links**: Create your own Platform model by selecting the "Platform model" on the screen. Use the "Add Node" button to create nodes individually and links using the "Add Link" button.

   - **Sliders**: delay and bandwidth for a node can be changed by clicking on the edge and adjusting the respective sliders.

   - **Delete Model**: The nodes and links can be deleted by first clicking on the "Delete Mode" button then selecting the node or link you want to delete.

   - **Generate Random Platform Model**: Generate a random platform model by entering the number of nodes. 

   - **Visualizing the Platform Model**:The Platform Model will be displayed as a graph. Nodes represent nodes, and edges represent links between the nodes.

4. **Shortcuts**

   - **Tab**: Switches between the Application and Platform model.
   - **When Application Model is selected**:
      - **'1'** will add a task.
      - **'2'** will add a dependency.
      - **'w'** will cycle through the tasks.
   - **When Platform Model is selected**:
      - **'1'** will add a node.
      - **'2'** will add a link.
      - **'w'** will cycle through the links.
 
5. **Visualizing the Schedules**

   - Along with the application and platform model, five different schedules are displayed, as implemented in the [backend](https://github.com/linem-davton/es-lab-task2).
   - Users can compare the different schedules generated by the algorithms.
   - Any changes made in the application or platform model will be immediately reflected in the Schedules.
